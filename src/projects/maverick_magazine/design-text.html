<p>A design and photography project to create a magazine, created for the spring 2017 class of ART 576 Advanced Typography at Kansas State University.</p>

<h1>Requirements</h1>
<p>Create a magazine based off of a classic fairytale.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Must be your own take on a classic fairytale.</li>
    <li>Must be a minimum of 14 pages, or 7 spreads.</li>
    <li>Create a title and cover for a magazine that this article would appear in.</li>
    <li>Focus on typographic elements and out they relate to the images.</li>
    <li>Pictures must be shot by you.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Style Choices</h1>
<P>Another Cinderella story.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The chosen story was a remake of Cinderella where a college freshman wanted to join a fraternity but his (three) friends were fraternities. He met a girl at a fraternity party but upon leaving to get home before his friends make it back dropped his keys. This girl came to give the keys back. When his friends see this girl they start to understand some connections could be made from fraternities.</li>
    <li>Maverick meaning "an independent individual who does not go along with a group or party" was chosen as the name for the magazine. A magazine for those who don't follow the group, like the guy in my Cinderella story.</li>
    <li>FRATrick was the name given to the article as Rick from the story wanted to join a frat, as well as mimicking the name of the magazine.</li>
</ul>

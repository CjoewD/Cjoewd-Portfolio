<p>Collaborative senior capstone project with an apparel design and marketing group, created for the Spring 2018 class of ART 580 Graphic Design Senior Studio at Kansas State University.</p>

<h1>Website Design</h1>
<ul>
    <li>The clients expressed that clothing would not be sold on the website. That there would be a blog, promotions, and Instagram feed with customers wearing Tied & True clothing.</li>
    <li>Bringing in the industrial appearance, I added the light brick repeating pattern in the header.</li>
    <li>A promotions bar was added under that for catching the users eye and easily viewable from any page.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Website Programming</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Only basic html, css and JavaScript was used.</li>
    <li>JavaScript was used for rotating the Instagram feed on the homepage (images and information from file), moving the fixed content box on the blog page, and the mobile hamburger menu.</li>
</ul>

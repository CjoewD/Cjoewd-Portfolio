<p>Personal logo and portfolio website, modified/created for the Fall 2017 class of ART 608 Intermediate Web Design at Kansas State University.</p>

<h1>Personal Logo</h1>
<p> I have been using some variant of this design since before being accepted into Graphic Design in Fall 2016. As my skills and Illustrator skills increased I would modify the design until I have what you see today.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Cj comes from my username of CjoewD, or Cody Joe</li>
    <li>I wanted the '}' in my personal logo to represent my computer science and technological side.</li>
    <li>I chose the colors of yellow and dark charcoal because yellow could represent my creative side, as well as being the color of my personality. Dark charcoal to give the logo some contrast and goes well with the yellow selected.</li>
    <li>The frame was added to give the piece some structure. </li>
    <li>I wanted an emphasis on the '}', thus yellow was selected as its color and the rest was to balance out the design.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Portfolio Website</h1>
<p>Overall this website was to give me an online presence and the experience of creating a website from the ground up.</p>
<ul>
    <li>My site name of CjoewD comes from a shorthand of my full name, Cody Joe Wilhelm. The 'D' was added because Iâ€™m an identical twin and the 'd' is the only letter different in our full names.</li>
    <li>For the site I wanted to pull a lot of the technology side of me into it. So I utilize a lot of programming syntax within the design.</li>
    <li>The icons are made completely out of coding symbols. Such as [], {}, &lt&gt, /\, and (). Each icon has a different main symbol' as an emphasis. </li>
    <li>The null objects in the sections with projects are to create some breathing room and fill in the grid structure as well as add more color cohesiveness to the site.</li>
    <li>The circuits were added to put a small amount of detail and structure to an otherwise simplistic site.</li>
    <li>The frame around the programming projects was added to clearly differentiate the two types of projects.</li>
</ul>

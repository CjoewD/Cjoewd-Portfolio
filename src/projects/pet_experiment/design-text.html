<p>A type experiment using the Pet brand evaporated milk packaging, created for the Fall 2016 class of ART 300 Experimental Type at Kansas State University.</p>

<h1>Requirements</h1>
<p>The project was based upon using all elements of the original packaging to create a design.</p>

<ul>
    <li>To start with we vectorized all of the type and artwork from the packaging.</li>
    <li>The designs must include all elements of the original design: type, images, lines, etc.. However, you could hide them or make them visually irrelevant.</li>
    <li>Initial designs were done in black and white. Later color was added and was used in proportion to the ratio of color on the packaging.</li>
    <li>The design must feel like the brand it originated from.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Style Choices</h1>
<ul>
    <li>I left mine in a rough state to keep a rustic feel to it, similar to the original packaging.</li>
    <li>The lines were utilized for adding order and structure to an otherwise organic style.</li>
</ul>

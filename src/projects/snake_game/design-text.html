<p>An implementation of the classic Snake game in HTML5, created for the Fall 2016 class of CIS 580 at Kansas State University.</p>

<h1>Design Requirements</h1>
<p>The game is implemented in JavaScript using the HTML5 canvas element using the provided game framework.</p>

<ul>
    <li>The snake consists of a head and multiple body segments which always follow behind it and are rendered on-screen. The segments should not be fixed in position, i.e. the tail should move around the screen. The head and body segments can be composed of rectangles, arcs, or images.</li>
    <li>Colliding the snake's head with a body segment loses the game.</li>
    <li>Periodically, an apple (image or arc) appears on-screen. If the snake's head collides with it, the user gains points in their score.</li>
    <li>Periodically, the snake grows an extra segment. This can either be timed, or triggered by eating an apple, or similar mechanism. The segment should appear at the end of the snake and behave like the existing segments.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Style Choices</h1>
<ul>
    <li>The choice to work with basic Javascript to create the artwork was made to familiarize myself with the concept in Javascript.</li>
    <li>The goal was to create a game that was simplistic and the choice was made to limit all the shapes in the game to circles of the same size.</li>
</ul>

<p>A simple plumbing game template in HTML5, created for the Fall 2016 class of CIS 580 at Kansas State University.</p>

<h1>Design Requirements</h1>
<ul>
    <li>The game world is divided into a regular grid, in which tiles representing pipes can be placed.</li>
    <li>At the start of each level, an un-editable starting pipe and ending pipe appear.</li>
    <li>At the start of the level, 'fluid' begins to flow from the start pipe. If the fluid manages to reach the end of assembled pipes, the game is lost.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Style Choices</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Most of the pipes were provided by open source location. Thin straight piece, large cross section, and starting/ending pipes modified by me.</li>
    <li>Dirt tiles were from open source locations.</li>
    <li>The user interface and water is made from Javascript code.</li>
    <li>The instruction page was made using Photoshop.</li>
</ul>

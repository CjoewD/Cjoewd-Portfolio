One that was very geometrical and precise, the other that had more curves to it.</li> <li>Green and cyan were the obvious color choices for the \"live your life\" design, very computer science colors.</li> <li>The other design I had a lot more fun with the colors but decided on a very muted color scheme to offset the other brightly colored design.</li> </ul> ",

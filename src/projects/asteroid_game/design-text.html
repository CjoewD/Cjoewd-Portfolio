<p>A clone of the arcade classic Asteroids in HTML5, created for the Fall 2016 class of CIS 580 at Kansas State University.</p>

<h1>Design Requirements</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Your game should involve steering a player's ship around space.</li>
    <li>You should render a significant number (at least ten) asteroids on screen. </li>
    <li>Asteroids should move along an initially random velocity vector. If they move off-screen, they should wrap to the opposite side of the screen.</li>
    <li>The player may shoot lasers, which travel across the screen and disappear when they cross the edge. </li>
    <li>A laser will break an asteroid into two or more smaller pieces when it hits them. These pieces have part of the original asteroid's mass, and velocities that move away from each other. If an asteroid is small enough, it is simply destroyed.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Style Choices</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Overall style of the game was chosen to be simple with just outlines of the objects.</li>
    <li>Asteroids change color, red color, when they are small enough to destroyed when hit.</li>
</ul>

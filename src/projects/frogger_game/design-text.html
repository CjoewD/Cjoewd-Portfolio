<p>A clone of the Konami classic Frogger in HTML5, created for the Fall 2016 class of CIS 580 at Kansas State University.</p>

<h1>Design Requirements</h1>
<ul>
    <li>The game should involve an animated player sprite with at least five frames of animation.</li>
    <li>Movement for the player should proceed in fixed increments, i.e. 'hopping', rather than 'walking'. Pushing the forward button should start a hop, which is then interpolated over several frames before a landing. </li>
    <li>Multiple obstacles appear in the game, and move vertically.</li>
    <li>A background appropriate to the game should have clear cues to where obstacles will appear (i.e. cars appear on a road, logs in a river).</li>
    <li>Some obstacles, i.e. cars, kill the player sprite when collided with.</li>
    <li>Other obstacles (i.e. logs, which keep the frog protagonist from drowning), are necessary to collide with.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Style Choices</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Frog and car sprites are provided by an open source location.</li>
    <li>Background and logs were made by myself using Illustrator.</li>
    <li>UI is drawn on using Javascript.</li>
</ul>

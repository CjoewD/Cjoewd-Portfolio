<p>An assignment template for a scrolling shooter, a clone of Tyrian created for the Fall 2016 class of CIS 580 at Kansas State University.</p>

<h1>Design Requirements</h1>
<p>The game is implemented in JavaScript using the HTML5 canvas element and the provided game framework.</p>
<ul>
    <li>When the player dies, they explode using a particle system.</li>
    <li>The player flies through a parallax scrolling world composed of at least three layers generated using tilemaps.</li>
    <li>The player ship can be upgraded with better weapons providing different advantages and visual representations on-screen. At least three of these implement particle effects.</li>
    <li>At least five unique types of enemies using different attack strategies and behaviors actively oppose the player's progress. Destroying an enemy causes an explosion or similar destruction implementing a particle engine.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Style Choices</h1>
<ul>
    <li>A hyper artistic approach was taken to tackle this game. The artwork was made by me in Photoshop.</li>
    <li>The three background layers are a repeating pattern that all advance at varying rates.</li>
    <li>The player ship is a modified design from an open source location.</li>
    <li>All enemies have a similar appearance to make them easy to differentiate from the other textures and shapes.</li>
</ul>

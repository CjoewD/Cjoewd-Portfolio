<p>A type experiment using three events from the SpringFest 2017 music festival, created for the Fall 2016 class of ART 300 Experimental Type at Kansas State University.</p>

<h1>Requirements</h1>
<p>All of the music posters must present the personality of the music of its event, yet feel as though it if from the same series.</p>

<ul>
    <li>All the information on the posters are required, no more and no less.</li>
    <li>Personality of the music must come across the design.</li>
    <li>Must feel as though it is from a set.</li>
    <li>Three of the music events must be covered.</li>
    <li>The posters must be square 10' by 10'.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Style Choices</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Two colors were used for each poster, a color to fit the music personality and black.</li>
    <li>I wanted the designs to play with figure/ground relationship.</li>
    <li>Jazz brought in a little bit of a quirky style.</li>
    <li>Trip-hop is really diverse and has that grunge and sharp look to it.</li>
    <li>Classical can be seen as somewhat general, but structured.</li>
</ul>
